# Poen

Geld moet rollen! A webapp to register income and expenses. Built to gain insight in my financial situation. Basically a calendar where you can input money transactions, where a balance is automatically calculated.

Right now, *Poen* supports multiple users, categories and a balance sheet. In the future, I would like to add support for charts and saving targets.
